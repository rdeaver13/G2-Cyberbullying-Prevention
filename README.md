# G2-Cyberbullying-Prevention
CS232-001 Group 2 Project Repository

This repository contains any class files and package folders for our project.
It will also act as a journal for keeping track of development.

As we commit changes within this repository, edit the README.md file with your changes. Please start your entry with your name the way I have below, that should make keeping track of who changes what much easier.

Ray: I found that using the prefix "/Folder-Name-Here/" in the file name when committing files, will create an unzipped folder to directly work in. I used the prefix "/GP2/" to assign the files from the zipped "GP2" folder into a new unzipped folder.

Ray: I wrote the rough draft for my part of the project, I also made extra txt files for displaying information through menus. There's definitely a lot I can do to optimize my code and it has not been tested yet.
