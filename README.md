# G2-Cyberbullying-Prevention
CS232-001 Group 2 Project Repository

This repository contains any class files and package folders for our project.
It will also act as a journal for keeping track of development.

Ray: I found that using the prefix "/Folder-Name-Here/" in the file name when committing files, will create an unzipped folder to directly work in.
Ray: I used the prefix "/GP2/" to assign the files from the zipped "GP2" folder into a new unzipped folder.
